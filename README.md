# antmk-VRC-Avatar
Avatar made from scratch to learn Blender. Welcome to use. 

twobytworobotpallet is the image for texture. (Added OtherTextureSizes folder for different size textures to be easier to customize.)

Meged FBX is ready to import into unity. 
(You will have to add VRC avatar descriptor,
would recommend to set camera height to 1.65.
Need to use autofix the couple problems in the vrc sdk control panel.
For quest compatibility you will need to make a VRC/Mobile/Standard-Lite material.)
!!Warning!! first time you sit down in a world you will be sent to the sky, each world. After first seat in world works fine.

Merged is model ready to be exported into FBX to import into Unity

Unmerged, parts of the body are seperate objects to be easy to change out only specific parts, all object origins should be at world origin
in order to Join objects.
!!WARNIGN!! normals will flip on some objects when you join them all together. 
-would recommend making normals visible
-click on a single face on each object with flipped normals and Ctrl + L to select all linked faces
-go to mesh -> normals -> flip normals
